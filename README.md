BuffaLogs is an Open Source Django Project whose main purpose is to detect anomalous logins.

In detail, it sends several types of alerts:
1.  **Impossible Travel**

    It occurs when a user logs into the system from a significant distance within a range of time that cannot be covered by conventional means of transport.

2.  **Login from new device**

    This alert is sent if the user utilizes a new appliance.

3.  **Login from a new country**

    This alert is dispatched if the system is logged by a user from a country where they have never authenticated before.

4. **Atypical country**

   This type of alert is triggered when the country from which the user logged in is not new, but unusual because not recent.

5. **User risk threshold**

   This alert is triggered every time that the risk_score of a user increases.

6. **Anonymous IP Login**

   This alert occurs to signal a login made with an anonymous IP.

7. **Stale account**

   The idea is to compare the logins provided by the internal authentication service of the company with the logins collected by BuffaLogs and alert in case of significant inconsistencies.

## BuffaLogs is participating in FOSDEM 2025 Conference!

[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/) is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Brussels.

These solutions often emphasize protection against sophisticated adversaries, zero-day exploits, and malicious insiders. However, our real-world experience reveals that the majority of initial compromises occur through simpler approaches, such as stolen credentials and phishing attacks. In this talk, we introduce Buffalogs, an open-source solution designed to detect and alert on anomalous login behaviors. Adhering to the Unix philosophy of "do one thing and do it well," Buffalogs offers a way to analyze common application logs (ssh, Apache, Microsoft Entra ID, etc) and detect credential misuse. Attendees will gain insights into the challenges of login anomaly detection, the development of Buffalogs and the differences between our solution and other commercial alternatives. |

##  Installation & Running
BuffaLogs employs the following tools which have to be installed on the machine:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
- [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Then, you can clone this repository on your local computer with:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:certego/BuffaLogs.git
```
Or download the application directly from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/certego/buffalogs), with the `sudo docker pull certego/buffalogs:<release_tag>`.

After that, there are two ways of running BuffaLogs, depending on your system configurations:
* if you already have an elastic cluster:
    *  set the address of the host into the `CERTEGO_ELASTICSEARCH` variable in the `buffalogs.env` file
    *  launch ` docker compose up -d` to run the containers
* if you have no hosts with Elasticsearch installed on it, you can run it directly with Buffalogs:
    * run `docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.elastic.yaml up -d` in order to execute all the containers, included Elasticsearch and Kibana
    * Now elasticsearch and kibana are running on the same host with Buffalogs.

##   Logs Structure

BuffaLogs is able to analyse logs coming from any source, provided that it complies with the Elastic Common Schema and with the given structure: 

    ```
    {
        "index": "<elastic_index>",
        "id": "<log_id>",
        "timestamp": "<log_timestamp>",
        "user": {
            "name": "<user_name>"
        },
        "source": {
            "geo": {
                "country_name": "<country_origin_log>",
                "location": {
                    "lat": "<log_latitude>",
                    "lon": "<log_longitude>"
                }
            },
            "as": {
                "organization": {
                    "name": "<ISP_name>"
                }
            },
            "ip": "<log_source_ip>",
            "intelligence_category": "<intelligence_category>"
        },
        "user_agent": {
            "original": "<log_device_user_agent>"
        },
        "event": {
            "type": "start",
            "category": "authentication",
            "outcome": "success"
        }
    }

    ```

##  REST APIs

Five views were implemented using DRF - Django-Rest Framework, in order to provide the possible to query and produce the charts data.
In particular, the supplied APIs are:
| **API's name**| **API result**|
|---|---|
| *users_pie_chart_api* | It returns the association between the risk level and the number of users with that risk score |
| *alerts_line_chart_api* | It provides the number of alerts triggered in a particular timeframe |
| *world_map_chart_api* | It supplies the relation of countries and the number of alerts triggered from them |
| *alerts_api* | It offers the details about the alerts generated in the provided interval |
| *risk_score_api* | It provides the association between user and risk level for the users whose risk changed in the requested timeframe |
