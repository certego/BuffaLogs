=========
BuffaLogs
=========

BuffaLogs is a Django app whose main purpose is to detect anomaly logins.

Detaild documentation is in the ``docs/`` directory.

Quick start
-----------

Only the backend features have been updated to be a Django Reusable App. The BuffaLogs interface is available only in the original Django Project cloning it in local.

1. Add "impossible_travel" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...,
        "impossible_travel",
    ]

2. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the BuffaLogs models.

3. Start the Django server with ``python manage.py runserver`` and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
   to analyze the BuffaLogs detections in the Django models.


For Developers
--------------

After each change to the source code, please remember to:
* update the CHANGELOG.md 
* update the version in the ``setup.cfg`` file

Now, it's possible to recreate the package with `python3 setup.py sdist` command.

After that, the new package contained in the `django-buffalogs/dist` folder can be imported in other projects. 

In the other projects, install the app with ``python -m pip install buffalogs-<version>.tar.gz`` command.

If you want to uninstall the application, run ``python -m pip uninstall buffalogs``.
